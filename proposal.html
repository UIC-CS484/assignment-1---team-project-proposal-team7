                        We are planning to use Google Maps RESTful API.
                        It will give users the ability to rate a place and save/bookmark it in their profile.
                        The places they rate will show up on their map and to the public only if they choose to.
                        We will collect most popular restaurants who rate by user, email/number, password, 
                        places that they review, and Location history ONLY IF they opt in.
